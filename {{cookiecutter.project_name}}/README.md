Does that person know I might need help? Can we block off some of their time to make sure that this project is prioritized?


## <ins>Previous knowledge</ins>

To your knowledge, has anyone else conducted similar work with similar research questions?
If so who?


Have consultants or other third parties taken a similar approach? If, so where do those artifacts/reports exist?
