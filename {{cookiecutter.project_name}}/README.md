## Stakeholders
Who is the audience for this research?


Who will use the results?


## Research Questions

What is it that you are wanting to learn?

What is your specific research question?

What is the outcome variable of interest?


## Data

What data will we need in order to be successful?

In what systems does this data live?


Who might be available to help me retrieve it if I have issues?


Who is the person most connected to understanding the data? If I need help explaining the actual features and information, who should I contact?


Does that person know I might need help? Can we block off some of their time to make sure that this project is prioritized?


## Previous knowledge

To your knowledge, has anyone else conducted similar work with similar research questions?
If so who?


Have consultants or other third parties taken a similar approach? If, so where do those artifacts/reports exist?


## Actionability

How do you plan to utilize this information? Is there a specific intervention or optimization you are trying to achieve? If not, why not? If not, should we investigate a different research question?

 

## Challenges and Limitations

What will not be addressed by this project?

 

Why is it not being addressed (data availability, ethics, the metaphysical and epistemological constraints of reality)?

 

Where do you foresee difficulties in this project, and do you have a plan to mitigate them if the arise?

 

## Deadline

When do you need this done?


Does that timeline align with a seasonal operational need? If not, can we delay this project and conduct it when the outcome will land closer to itâ€™s use?
